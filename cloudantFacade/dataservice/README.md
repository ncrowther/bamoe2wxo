# Cloudant Facade for WXO

This package creates a datafacade into a Cloudant database.  
The facade is exposed as an OpenAPI where it can be ingested by WatsonxOrchestrate. 
See:

 [OpenApi](\openapi\dataApi.yaml)

### Local host Prerequisites

 * Create IBM Cloud account with Cloudant.  See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-getting-started-with-cloudant 
 
 * Create a Cloudant database with name wxodb

 * Create credentials for next step

### Run on local host

 Edit setenv.bat to cloudant credentials (see prereqs)
 Open DOS prompt (NOT powershell).  Enter:

 ```sh
   setenv.bat
```

 Start a local nodejs server: 
 
```sh
   npm start
```

### Code Engine Hosting Prerequisites

 * Follow Local Host Prerequisites above
 
 * Create IBM Cloud account with Code Engine. 

 * Create a code engine project (eg name sample)

 * Create a code engine configmap configuration containing Cloudant credentials: CLOUDANT_APIKEY=XXX, CLOUDANT_URL=XXX, DBNAME=wxodb

 * Assign the config map to the Code Engine project

### Deployment to code engine on IBM Cloud

1.	Open Git Bash shell from VSC

2.	Login to IBM Cloud.

    ibmcloud login --sso

3.	In the IBM Cloud console, go to Manage > Account > Account resources > Resource groups.  Select the resource group for Code Engine. E.g. default

    ibmcloud target -g default

4.	Select the code engine project:  

    ibmcloud ce project select -n [PROJECT_NAME]

5.	Start Docker Desktop

7.	Within this folder, edit CEbuild.sh and CErun.sh and change the REGISTRY to your Docker registry.

8.	Using the same bash shell, deploy the sample application to your docker repo:

./CEbuild

9.	Deploy the application to Code Engine on IBM Cloud. From the app's folder do:

./CErun

10.	Open the URL using the IBM Cloud Code Engine route for the refunds application
